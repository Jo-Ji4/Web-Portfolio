# Web-Portfolio
Website Description

This website is a collaborative team portfolio that showcases the full journey of our data analytics project — from raw data to actionable business insights. Built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, the site introduces each team member, outlines their roles, and presents a clean walkthrough of the entire project process.

The portfolio includes detailed sections for:

* **Team Contributions**: Highlighting individual responsibilities in data cleaning, visualization, and presentation.
* **Project Overview**: Explaining the problem, our approach, tools used, and final outcomes.
* **Interactive Elements**: Smooth animations (via AOS), structured layouts, and responsive design to enhance user experience.

Whether you're exploring our team’s skill set, reviewing our work process, or viewing the final deliverables, this site reflects both our technical ability and our commitment to clear, engaging storytelling.
